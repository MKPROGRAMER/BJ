# What is Java ?
The Java programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Although it is primarily used for Internet-based applications, Java is a simple, efficient, general-purpose language. Java was originally designed for embedded network applications running on multiple platforms.
# What is Blue-J
BlueJ is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the Java programming language, developed mainly for educational purposes, but also suitable for small-scale software development. It runs with the help of JDK (Java Development Kit).

BlueJ was developed to support the learning and teaching of object-oriented programming, and its design differs from other development environments as a result.[2] The main screen graphically shows the class structure of an application under development (in a UML-like diagram), and objects can be interactively created and tested. This interaction facility, combined with a clean, simple user interface, allows easy experimentation with objects under development. Object-oriented concepts (classes, objects, communication through method calls) are represented visually and in its interaction design in the interface.
# Java defines the following eight primitive data types:
1.char.
